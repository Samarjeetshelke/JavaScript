The `width` and `max-width` properties in CSS are used to control the size of an element, but they serve different purposes and behave differently. Here's an explanation of each and the differences between them:

### `width`

The `width` property sets the width of an element. It defines the element's width explicitly, and the element will maintain this width regardless of its content or the size of its container.

**Example:**

```css
.box {
    width: 300px;
    background-color: lightblue;
}
```

- **Behavior**: The element will always be 300 pixels wide.
- **Use Case**: Use `width` when you want to set a fixed width for an element.

### `max-width`

The `max-width` property sets the maximum width an element can have. It allows the element to be smaller than the specified value but never larger. This property is particularly useful in responsive design, where the element should adjust its size based on the container or viewport size.

**Example:**

```css
.box {
    max-width: 300px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

- **Behavior**: The element will shrink if the container is smaller than 300 pixels, but it will never be wider than 300 pixels.
- **Use Case**: Use `max-width` to ensure that an element does not exceed a certain width, allowing it to be flexible and responsive to different screen sizes.

### Differences Between `width` and `max-width`

1. **Fixed vs. Flexible**:
   - `width` sets a fixed size for an element, making it rigid and unresponsive to the container's size.
   - `max-width` sets a limit on the maximum size, allowing the element to be flexible and adapt to smaller container sizes.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - `width` is generally not used in responsive design because it can cause elements to overflow their containers on smaller screens.
   - `max-width` is ideal for responsive design as it ensures elements stay within a specified limit while allowing them to shrink as needed.

3. **Content Overflow**:
   - With `width`, if the content inside the element is larger than the specified width, it may overflow, causing layout issues.
   - With `max-width`, the element can shrink to accommodate the content and container, reducing the risk of overflow.

### Practical Example

Consider a webpage with a container that can resize based on the viewport width:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="fixed-width">Fixed Width</div>
    <div class="max-width">Max Width</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.fixed-width {
    width: 300px;
    background-color: lightblue;
}

.max-width {
    max-width: 300px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

- **`.fixed-width`**: This element will always be 300 pixels wide, regardless of the container size.
- **`.max-width`**: This element will be up to 300 pixels wide, but will shrink if the container is smaller.

### Conclusion

- **Use `width`** when you need an element to have a specific, unchanging width.
- **Use `max-width`** to create flexible, responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes while respecting a maximum limit.
