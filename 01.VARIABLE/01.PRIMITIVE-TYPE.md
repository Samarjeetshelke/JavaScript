JavaScript has several data types, which can be categorized into primitive data types and non-primitive (or reference) data types.

### Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic types of data and are immutable (their values cannot be changed).

1. **Number**
   - Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   ```javascript
   let integer = 42;
   let float = 3.14;
   ```

2. **String**
   - Represents a sequence of characters.
   ```javascript
   let greeting = "Hello, world!";
   ```

3. **Boolean**
   - Represents logical values: `true` or `false`.
   ```javascript
   let isJavaScriptFun = true;
   let isRaining = false;
   ```

4. **Undefined**
   - Represents an uninitialized variable or a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   ```javascript
   let something;
   console.log(something); // Output: undefined
   ```

5. **Null**
   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   ```javascript
   let empty = null;
   ```

6. **Symbol** (ES6)
   - Represents a unique and immutable identifier.
   ```javascript
   let sym = Symbol("unique");
   ```

7. **BigInt** (ES11)
   - Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
   ```javascript
   let bigNumber = BigInt(123456789012345678901234567890);
   ```

### Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Non-primitive data types are objects and can hold collections of values.

1. **Object**
   - Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
   ```javascript
   let person = {
       name: "Alice",
       age: 25,
       isStudent: true
   };
   ```

2. **Array**
   - Represents an ordered list of values.
   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

3. **Function**
   - Represents a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
   ```javascript
   function greet(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name;
   }
   ```

4. **Date**
   - Represents a single moment in time.
   ```javascript
   let now = new Date();
   ```

5. **RegExp**
   - Represents a regular expression, used for pattern matching within strings.
   ```javascript
   let pattern = /abc/;
   ```

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Primitive Data Types
let age = 30; // Number
let name = "John"; // String
let isStudent = false; // Boolean
let address; // Undefined
let salary = null; // Null
let id = Symbol("id"); // Symbol
let bigIntNum = BigInt(9007199254740991); // BigInt

// Non-Primitive Data Types
let person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe"
}; // Object

let hobbies = ["Reading", "Traveling", "Swimming"]; // Array

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
} // Function

let currentDate = new Date(); // Date

let regex = /ab+c/; // RegExp
```

Understanding these data types is fundamental to writing effective JavaScript code. Each type has its own set of properties and methods that can be used to manipulate and interact with the values they represent.
